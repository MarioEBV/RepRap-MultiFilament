# RepRap-MultiFilament
Multi filament drive for RepRap and other FFF printers

The drive has three components:

  1. Multi-drive - a pinch-wheel drive for multiple filaments driven by a single stepper and a small DC motor.
  2. Guillotine - a device that cuts filament driven by the same small DC motor.
  3. Filament-Y - a passive device that merges feeds of filament into a single Bowden channel.
